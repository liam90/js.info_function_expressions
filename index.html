  <h1>JS.info Function Expressions</h1>
  <p>As the function creation happens in the context of the assignment expression (to the right side of =), this is a Function Expression.</p>
  <code>
    let sayHi = function() { <br>
      console.log('Hello World'); <br>
    } <br><br>
    sayHi(); // The output bring Hello World
  </code>
  <p>We can even copy functions to other variables as well</p>
  <code>
    let myFunc = sayHi;

    myFunc(); // This will give us the same result as sayHi which is "Hello World"  
  </code>
  <h2>Callback Functions</h2>
  <p>In practice, such functions are quite useful. The major difference between a real-life ask and the example above is that real-life functions use more complex ways to interact with the user than a simple confirm. In the browser, such functions usually draw a nice-looking question window. But that’s another story.
    The arguments showOk and showCancel of ask are called callback functions or just callbacks.
    The idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be “called back” later if necessary. In our case, showOk becomes the callback for “yes” answer, and showCancel for “no” answer.
    We can use Function Expressions to write an equivalent, shorter function:
    </p>
    <code>
      function ask(question, yes, no) { <br>
        if (confirm(question)) yes() <br>
        else no(); <br>
      } <br>
      function showOk() { <br>
        alert('You agree'); <br>
      } <br>
      function showCancel() { <br>
        alert('You canceled the execution'); <br>
      } <br><br>
      
      ask("Do you agree", showOk, showCancel);
    </code>
    <h2>Function Declaration vs Function Expression</h2>
    <p>Function Declaration: a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow:</p>
    <h3>Function Declaration</h3>
    <code>
      function sum(a, b) { <br>
        return a + b; <br>
      } <br>
    </code>
    <p>Function Expression: a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct. Here, the function is created on the right side of the “assignment expression” =:</p>
    <h3>Function expression</h3>
    <code>
      let sum = function(a, b) {<br>
        return a + b;<br>
      };<br>
    </code>
